I'm trying to create a simple CO-RE POC.
For that I'm trying to load the program in ebpf/main.c (an example tracepoint program) after the original program couldn't be loaded in my machines
I've made some changes to the user mode code to be able to load this simple program

KRIe is a research project that aims to detect Linux Kernel exploits with eBPF. KRIe is far from being a bulletproof strategy: from eBPF related limitations to post exploitation detections that might rely on a compromised kernel to emit security events, it is clear that a motivated attacker will eventually be able to bypass it.
That being said, the goal of the project is to make attackers' lives harder and ultimately prevent out-of-the-box exploits from working on a vulnerable kernel.

KRIe has been developed using [CO-RE (Compile Once - Run Everywhere)](https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2020/02/19/bpf-portability-and-co-re.html) so that it is compatible with a large range of kernel versions. If your kernel doesn't export its BTF debug information, KRIe will try to download it automatically from [BTFHub](https://github.com/aquasecurity/btfhub). If your kernel isn't available on BTFHub, but you have been able to manually generate your kernel's BTF data, you can provide it in the configuration file (see below).

### System requirements

This project was developed on Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (Linux Kernel 5.15) and has been tested on older releases down to Ubuntu Bionic 18.04 (Linux Kernel 4.15).

- golang 1.18+
- (optional) Kernel headers are expected to be installed in `lib/modules/$(uname -r)`, update the `Makefile` with their location otherwise.
- (optional) clang & llvm 14.0.6+

Optional fields are required to recompile the eBPF programs.

### Build

1) Since KRIe was built using CORE, you shouldn't need to rebuild the eBPF programs. That said, if you want still want to rebuild the eBPF programs, you can use the following command:

```shell script
# ~ make build-ebpf
```

2) To build KRIE, run:

```shell script
# ~ make build
```

3) To install KRIE (copy to /usr/bin/krie) run:
```shell script
# ~ make install
```

### Getting started

KRIe needs to run as root. Run `sudo krie -h` to get help.

```shell script
# ~ krie -h
Usage:
  krie [flags]

Flags:
      --config string   KRIe config file (default "./cmd/krie/run/config/default_config.yaml")
  -h, --help            help for krie
```

### Configuration

```yaml
